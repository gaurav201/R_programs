Cleaning and Getting Data course project code book
Files

The projexct uses following 6 files

    x_train.txt : Training feature dataset
    y_train.txt : Training label dataset
    subject_train.txt : Training Subsjects (Subject IDs)
    x_test.txt : Test feature dataset
    y_test.txt : Test label dataset
    subject_test.txt : Test Subsjects (Subject IDs)

Additionally following files were used

    activity_labels.txt : A mapping of activity label and description
    features.txt : A mapping of feature ID and name

Process

The script run_analysis.R is the primary script for the entire data pipeline Followng steps are perdormed

    01 - The data directory is searched on the local system. If it does not exists, the dataset archive files is searched. If this is also missing dataset is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    02 - If the dataset archive is found or downloaded, it is unzupped in data directory, overwriting anything already existing
    03 - First the features.txt is read to get all feature names
    04 - The important features which are mean and standard-deviation of all measures are are collected
    05 - The feature names are cleansed. All brackets are removed and dots and commas are converted to underscores
    06 - Next all training features x_train.txt are read and assigned names from step 05
    07 - All training labels are read from y_train.txt
    08 - All training subjects are read from subject_train.txt
    09 - The above 3 data tables are combined into one data table for Training-Set
    10 - Next all testing features x_test.txt are read and assigned names from step 05
    11 - All test labels are read from y_test.txt
    12 - All test subjects are read from subject_test.txt
    13 - The above 3 data tables are combined into one data table for Test-set
    14 - Traing and test sets from step 09 and 13 are combined into one big set
    15 - Only important labels from step 04 are retained
    16 - All activity labels are read from activity_labels.txt
    17 - The labes in merged dataset are replaced with descriptions from step 16
    18 - Tidy data table is persisted to disk
    19 - A summary data table with mean values per subject and activity is calculated
    20 - the summary data table is persisted to disk
